## Recipes For The Impatient Reader

A typical recipe found online has a bunch of words I don't care about
that are unrelated to the recipe at hand.

Within this repository, I plan to collate recipes (with my additions and 
changes) without the boilerplate.

If you want to get the typical blog experience instead, just imagine that
I wrote a bunch of nonsense about a dead relative and time spent at their
house in front of each recipe.

### Format

The recipes are in the [GitHub flavor of Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) because that's the right answer.

They begin with the entire ingredient list and finish with instructions.

I don't include any kind of time estimate because humans are bad at time
and I am especially bad at it.

### PRs

Feel free to put in a PR if you have recipes you'd like to contribute. I 
reserve the right to refuse recipes even if they're tasty and you formatted
them correctly.

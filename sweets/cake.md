## Ingredients

- 3 3/4 cups chocolate (or white chocolate) morsels
- 1 1/3 cup milk
- 14oz sugar
- 13.3oz flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 1.5 sticks of butter, kept at room temperature long enough to have that playdough-ish consistency
- Pam or other nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

- Note all speeds listed are those of a KitchenAid stand mixer with speeds Low-5. Cue 'this one goes up to 5' jokes.
- Choose either the 14oz sugar:13.3oz flour ratio described in the ingredients list, or swap the ratios if desired (13.3oz sugar:14oz flour).
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Prepare cake pans. Two nine-inch diameter cake pans, sprayed thoroughly with Pam or your preferred spray.
- Mix butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl with the following parameters: Start on low stir for 15 sec, then up to 2-4 speed for 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl once or twice during that time; it should look "porous," like air is expanding it; nice, mixed, crumbly; can mix longer if desired.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients. 
- Add 1/3 of the total dry ingredient mix to the mixer with the wet ingredients, speed on ~ 2-4; it will spill some, but that's ok.
- After texture thickens and then all white flour looks mostly incorporated (maybe 8-10 sec), add half of the milk at the same mixing speed -- it'll splash a bit.
- Once the milk is spread evenly throughout, add the remaining dry-ingredients mix, mix only a few seconds, then add the last half of milk. It should look thick and dough-y and make soft peaks when lifting the batter head (don't use a whisk attachment for this). 
- The peaks should gently drip off somewhat, exhibiting no stiffness.
- Cook in the preheated oven for 35 (ish) minutes, or until golden brown on top. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before getting the cakes out of the pans.

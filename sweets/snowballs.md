## Ingredients
- 3/4 cup butter or margarine (one and a half sticks)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (works best if sifted during measuring)
- pinch salt
- 0 to 1 cup pecans or appropriate affordable nut (to taste); can be left off in case of allergies
- powdered sugar

## Instructions
- mix flour and salt in a dry mixing bowl and set aside
- cream butter and sugar
- beat in egg and vanilla
- mix continously, slowly adding flour
- stir in pecans or nut of choice or nothing at all (stupid sexy recipe)
- coat hands in flour 
- take a small pinch of dough roughly the size of a fifty-cent piece in diameter, roll into a ball, and place on a flat non-stick baking sheet or pan. Continue until all dough is used
= cook on 325 degree heat for 11 minutes, check for done-ness (golden brown on bottom of cookies), and add 2 minutes as needed until done-ness is achieved.
- Allow cookies to cool, then coat in powdered sugar. Putting the powdered sugar into a ziploc bag, throwing cookies in and shaking until coated is my preferred method.

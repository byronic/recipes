## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 and 1/2 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or preferred oil, or replace with melted cooled
  butter)

## Instructions

- Mix all dry ingredients
- Add the oil and mix again
- Mix in the remaining ingredients
- Put a griddle or skillet pan onto the stove, at medium to medium-high heat
- I recommend ~ 1/4 cup batter per pancake, but that can make them kind of
small. Make 'em as big or small as you prefer.
- Flip after roughly two to four minutes of cooking, the batter on top of
the pancake should be bubbly.
- Serve with plain syrup or whatever you like.

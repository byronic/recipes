## Ingredients

- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast (or activated yeast with 1/2 cup of the water)
- 1 1/2 cups room temperature water

## Instructions

- In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and yeast together until mixed (unless added to water).
- Stir in the water until a chunky, thick dough forms. If it needs a little more water, add a few more tablespoons, just enough to get it barely wet throughout.
- Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 12-18 hours at room temperature.
- Preheat the oven to 450f.
- Gently scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface and gently shape it into a ball with flour on the outside and set on a piece of parchment.
- The dough can still be very wet, so move it to a baking dish with high wall, or a Dutch Oven.
- Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake another 10-15 minutes to get the exterior nice and golden brown and crispy.
- Remove from the oven and let cool.
